objectives:
  - Add CI/CD to your project.
questions:
  - How do I run a simple GitHub Actions job?
hidden: false
keypoints:
  - Creating `.github/workflows/main.yml` is the first step to salvation.
  - Pipelines are made of jobs with steps.
  - ACT is especially useful to check and run GitHub Actions jobs (locally) before pushing changes.

## Adding CI/CD to a project

The first thing we'll do is create a `.github/workflows/main.yml` file in the project.
```bash
cd virtual-pipelines-eventselection/
mkdir -p .github/workflows
```

Open `.github/workflows/main.yml` with your favorite editor and add the following
~~~
name: example
on: push
jobs:
  greeting:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      -run: echo hello world
~~~
{: .language-yaml}

## Run GitHub Actions

### Run on your computer

At this point we need the [nektos/act](https://github.com/nektos/act) tool.

You can run
```bash
act -l  # -l stands for list (list workflows)
```

What happened??? We can see that this failed because the YAML was invalid... (Error: yaml: line ...)

We should fix this accondingly to the Error message. **Note** that `act` is not a YAML Validator but can help. Some YAML Validators: [https://yamllint.readthedocs.io](https://yamllint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), [https://codebeautify.org/yaml-validator](https://codebeautify.org/yaml-validator), [http://www.yamllint.com/](http://www.yamllint.com/), ...

Let's rerun:
```bash
act -l
```
This should print out the job name, *i.e* greeting:
<!--![Hello world list]({{site.baseurl}}/fig/act_list_greeting.png)-->

```
ID          Stage  Name
greeting    0      greeting
```
{: .output}

To run `greeting` do

```bash
act -j greeting  # -l stands for job (run job)
```

<!--![greeting job]({{site.baseurl}}/fig/act_run_greeting.png)-->
```
[example/greeting] üöÄ  Start image=catthehacker/ubuntu:act-latest
[example/greeting]   üê≥  docker run image=catthehacker/ubuntu:act-latest entrypoint=["/usr/bin/tail" "-f" "/dev/null"] cmd=[]
[example/greeting] ‚≠ê  Run echo hello world
| hello world
[example/greeting]   ‚úÖ  Success - echo hello world
```
{: .output}

### Run on GitHub

We've created the `.github/workflows/main.yml` file but it's not yet on GitHub. Next step we'll push these changes to GitHub so that it can run our job.
Since we're adding a new feature (Actions) to our project, we'll work in a feature branch. This is just a human-friendly named branch to indicate that it's adding a new feature.

```bash
cd virtual-pipelines-eventselection/
git checkout -b feature/add-actions
git add .github/workflows/main.yml
git commit -m "my first actions"
git push -u origin feature/add-actions
```

And that's it! You've successfully run your CI/CD job and you can view the output. You just have to navigate to the GitHub webpage for the `virtual-pipelines-eventselection` project and hit Actions button, you will find details of your job (status, output,...).

![GitHub Actions Page]({{site.baseurl}}/fig/actions_commits_page.png)

From this page, click through until you can find the output for the successful job run which should look like the following
![CI/CD Hello World Success Output]({{site.baseurl}}/fig/actions_first_ci-cd_success.png)


## Pull Request

Lastly, we'll open up a pull request for this branch, since we plan to merge this back into master when we're happy with the first iteration of the Actions.

### Work In Progress?

If you expect to be working on a branch for a bit of time while you have a pull request open, it's good etiquette to mark it as a Work-In-Progress (WIP). However this is not a built-in feature of GitHub, it requires to install it from [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/wip). Free for personal account.
